    <h2>ABILITY</h2><div><p>
    I have an ear for music. I love to write songs. What I do is I think of characters or emotions and I begin to write a poem then I find help with fellow musicians and we add music and turn it into a song. I’m in the process of writing and creating my own brand of music.</p></div>
    <h2>WISDOM</h2>
    <div><p> I don’t my best to learn from my mistakes and to do better in the future. I keep a kind eye on those around me. I try to be thoughtful towards people I care about not just so they can be there for me but so I can be a shoulder to lean on when they need me.</p></div>
