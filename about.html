  <main> <h2>WIT</h2> <div><p>
    I don’t always know what to say at the moment. Sometimes there are moments where I feel like I can simply be myself without judgment. It's not often that happens or that you find people you can feel comfortable with. When I am I feel calm like it wouldn’t matter how weird I am I still be accepted and have friends who like me just the way I am.</p></div>
    <h2>CLEVERNESS</h2>
    <div><p>I’m a slow learner. It takes time for me to process information longer to understand it but with good time and practice I eventually start to learn. I’m not a natural genius. My intelligence works in different skill sets and in different ways it makes for good use.</p></div>
<h2>INTELLECTUAL</h2>
<div><p>I’m not perfect. I have many flaws, fears and insecurities. There are moments when I feel myself just about to snap. Finding ways to cope hasn’t been easy. I found different methods over the years. In due time I found trust and ones to confide in when things feel shaking or when I feel alone. Because of that I was able to relax and to be myself.</p></div>
